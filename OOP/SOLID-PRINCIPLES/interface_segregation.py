"""
Interface is a set of methods an object must have
ISP states that 1 interface should be as small as possible in terms of cohesion
An interface should rather have many small cohesive methods rather than one large interface
Subclasses of a class shouldn't be forced to implement interfaces that they do not use
so we should make fine-grained interfaces which are client specific.
